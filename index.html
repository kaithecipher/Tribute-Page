                                <li>Zoro was born 21 years ago in the East Blue. By the time he was 8 years old,
                                    Zoro trained at a dojo in Shimotsuki Village. Zoro stated in the Baratie, that,
                                    "Once he decided that he would become an invincible swordsman, he left his life
                                    behind". Even as a child, Zoro was strong enough to defeat most adults, but
                                    could not defeat Kuina, the daughter of the dojo's master, Koushirou. During a
                                    training session, he got to meet Kuina's grandfather, Shimotsuki Kozaburo, who
                                    gifted him a pair of swords to aid in his practice. After their 2000th fight
                                    (and Kuina's 2000th victory), Zoro challenged her in private for one more
                                    match—with real swords. Although he had improved tremendously since their first
                                    match, he still lost and cried with frustration, telling Kuina about his dream
                                    of becoming the world's greatest swordsman. Hearing this, Kuina confided in
                                    Zoro, telling him that she shared the same dream but knew she could never attain
                                    it. Her father had told her that girls could never be true sword masters, and
                                    that her fighting potential would decrease as her body matured. Zoro, annoyed by
                                    her defeatist attitude in spite of repeatedly winning against him, told her that
                                    one day he would beat her because he was more skilled, not because she was a
                                    girl. The two made a promise—that either of them had to become the world's best
                                    swordsman. The next day, Kuina suffered a fatal fall down the stairs of her
                                    dojo, much to Zoro's anger and disappointment. Realizing that she would never
                                    have a chance to fulfill her dream, Zoro took it upon himself, asking Koushirou
                                    for her sword, Wado Ichimonji, and began working to develop his signature Three
                                    Sword Style, holding his own two swords in each hand, and Kuina's clenched
                                    between his teeth.<p>
                                    <li>After leaving the Marine Base, Zoro and Luffy realized that they had no
                                        knowledge on navigation, and began searching for a navigator. Luffy then managed
                                        to get his head stuck in the beak of a giant bird, leaving Zoro to paddle after
                                        him. Zoro came across three pirates adrift at sea, and told them to get on
                                        quickly because he was not stopping. The three were revealed to be pirates
                                        working for Buggy the Clown and planned to rob or kill Zoro.<p>
                                        <li>After being carried away from the fight between Nightmare Luffy and Oars by
                                            the Thriller Bark Victim's Association, he regained consciousness and helped
                                            Luffy use Giant Bazooka to shatter Oars' spine. As Moria used Shadow Asgard, he
                                            stood by watching the fight between Moria and Luffy and was almost burned away
                                            by the sun until, with the defeat of Moria, his shadow was finally returned.
                                            After launching an attack on the Thriller Bark Victim's Association, Bartholomew
                                            Kuma targeted Zoro. Zoro vs. Kuma. Zoro tried to fight Kuma, but Kuma just
                                            pushed his attacks away with his Nikyu Nikyu no Mi, leaving Zoro at a
                                            disadvantage. Kuma then came with an ultimatum: give up Luffy and the rest will
                                            be allowed to survive. Zoro, the crew, and the Thriller Bark Victim's
                                            Association, all in one voice, refused and so Kuma calmly detonated the island
                                            with an Ursus Shock, knocking out everybody. However, when Kuma was about to
                                            take Luffy, Zoro rose again as one of the only people not knocked unconscious
                                            and even launches a successful Shishi Sonson attack on Kuma, revealing that he
                                            is a cyborg. Kuma then stated that he is a cyborg but not like "Cyborg" Franky
                                            and furthermore explained that he was an incomplete human weapon created by the
                                            World Government and Dr. Vegapunk, called a Pacifista. Zoro then proceeded to
                                            ask for his head to be taken in exchange for Luffy's. Kuma agreed, but at that
                                            point, Sanji woke up and wanted to give his head instead. Zoro calmly hit one of
                                            his wounds just above his right hip and knocked Sanji out. Kuma then proceeded
                                            to use his powers and drew out all of Luffy's pain and fatigue. Luffy had so
                                            much pain and fatigue that it formed a gigantic paw of energy bigger than Kuma
                                            himself. Kuma gave Zoro a small sample of it and Zoro could barely tolerate the
                                            pain. Kuma then stated that if Zoro were to take in Luffy's injuries, he would
                                            definitely die. Zoro then asked to choose a location.
